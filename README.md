# Horse Hangman

## Overview

[Horse Hangman](https://horse-hangman.herokuapp.com/) is a python terminal game that runs on Heroku.

### How to Play
The game is based on the traditional Hangman word guessing game, the only difference is that all the words for this game are related to horses. The game starts with asking for the user to enter their name before asking the user to input a letter. The user has six lives (attempts) and if a letter is guessed wrong the user looses a life and the hangman picture starts to build, as the user looses lives the colour of the Hangman picture updates from Green to Yellow and then to the Red danger zone. On completion of the game the user has the option to 'Play Again' or exit the game.

### Features Left to Implement

- User Score Board
- Improve Game display
- Add logo/ improve art work
- Add multiple game levels e.g Easy, Moderate, Hard
       

## Languages Used
- Python


## Frameworks, Libaries and technologies used

- [Git/ Github](https://github.com/) - Git/Github was used for version control, storage and deployment of the project.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Heroku was used to deploy and create the terminal application.
- [Techsini](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup) - This was used for the mockup image in the overview.


## Testing Conducted 

### Usability testing 

I tested the game application thoroughly and repetitively throughout the python coding, using print() where necessary and the python3 run.py in the Git terminal. 
I also had work colleagues and family members assistance to test the site usability. 
I tested all game actions/ functions to ensure that they were working as expected.
I tested the game rules logic was working as expected.

Test Scripts actioned:

1. Test that greeting message loads as expected and User can input a valid name:

- Navigate to Heroku deployed link
- Check greeting loads as expected
- Enter a valid name 
- Test passed 

2. Test that greeting message loads as expected and User is asked to re-input their name if invalid data is entered:

- Navigate to Heroku deployed link
- Check greeting loads as expected
- Enter an invalid name containing special characters/ numbers
- User is presented with message stating name is invalid please enter a valid name
- Test passed 

The conclusion of repeating the above test scripts multiple times was that:

- The game itself was understandable and easy to follow.
- The random select word logic is working as expected.
- The game handles invalid data entry correctly.
- The guess counters are being incremented correcly.
- The game only actions the play again function once all guess attempts or when the word has been guessed corectly.
- answered.


### Bugs

- Hangman pic build backwards
- Return key
- multiple letters entered
- play again - any letter will exit the game 

### Content 

I reviewed all content on the site for:
- grammar and spelling mistakes
- Hangman pictures are placed properly with proper sizes & displaying as expected
- Instructions are clear and contain correct information
- Verified all text/ headings are displaying correctly



### Validation

I ran all the Python Code through [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)

No errors detected

# Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. 

The steps to deploy are as follows: 

- Log in to Heroku or create an account
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select Create New App
- You must enter a unique app name
- Next select your region
- Click on the Create App button
- The next page is the projectâ€™s Deploy Tab. Click on the Settings Tab and scroll down to Config Vars
- Click Reveal Config Vars and enter port into the Key box and 8000 into the Value box and click the Add button
- Scroll down to the Buildpack section click Add Buildpack select python and click Save Changes
- Repeat step 8 to add node.js. o Note: The Buildpacks must be in the correct order. If not click and drag them to move into the correct order
- Go to the top of the page and choose the Deploy tab
- Select Github as the deployment method
- Confirm you want to connect to GitHub
- Search for the repository name and click the connect button
- Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type
- Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github

  - On submission the project is forked in Github, by forking the project a copy of the original repository is made that can be viewed without affecting the original repository by following these steps: In the GitHub repository, locate the settings, above this is the option to 'fork', select this to create a copy

  - Cloning a repository: When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. It makes it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits.
