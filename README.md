# Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

  - On submission the project it is forked, by forking the project a copy of the original repository is made that can be viewed without affecting the original repository by following these steps: In the GitHub repository, locate the settings, above this is the option to 'fork', select this to create a copy

  - Cloning a repository: When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. It makes it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits.
